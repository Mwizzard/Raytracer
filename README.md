# Raytracer
this project contains a simple ray tracer made using the tutorial "RayTracingInOneWeekend" wich can be found here : https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

# Building project

I am using c-make to build the project.

```bash
  cmake --build build
```
is used to build the project.

To execute the program, you need to execute this command from the root of the project
```bash
  build/RayTracing > image.ppm
```
This redirects the output to a .ppm file

# Note 
This project was made to learn the basics of ray-tracing and is probably not bug-free
