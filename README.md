# Raytracer
this project contains a simple ray tracer made using the tutorial "RayTracingInOneWeekend" wich can be found here : https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

# Building project

C-make is used to build the project. To build, simply run:
```bash
  cmake --build build
```

To execute the program, you need to execute this command from the root of the project:
```bash
  build/RayTracing > image.ppm
```
This redirects the output to a .ppm file wich is the format used for the program because of its simplicity.

# Note 
This project was made to learn the basics of ray-tracing and is probably not bug-free
